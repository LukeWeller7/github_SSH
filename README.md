# Connecting to GitHub using SSH


### 1. .ssh folder

- Starting in Git bash you will need to go to the start point of your directory by using ```cd```
- In here you will need to check if you have a .ssh folder. To do so, enter the following ```ls -a```.
- It should appread near the top of the list as it is a hidden file.
- If you can see the '.ssh' file then you can skip to step 2.
- If there is no file you can create one using ```mkdir .ssh```
### 2. Creating SSH Key

- Git Bash you want to firstly create your key pairs, to do this you need to use the following command. ```ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"```
  - ```-t rsa``` sets the tpye of keygen you require (rsa is default)
  - ```-b 4096``` determines the byte lenght
  - ```-C "your_smail@example.com``` comments the end of the key with a note (commonly your email)
- Once you run this command you should see the following response:
```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/lukew/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/lukew/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/lukew/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
********************************************** lp.weller01@gmail.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
+----[******]-----+
```
- Input Response:
  - To start you can enter the name of the file to which you want your ssh key to be saved (leave blank by pressing enter and the default "id_rsa" will be the name)
  - Enter passphrase, enter the passphrase you want (recommended to just leave blank and press enter)
  - In place of ******* will be where your public key is generated as well as a randomart image found inside the square
- Once you've done this, do ```ls``` to check that two files have been generated in. (One should have .pub referring to the public key, the other is your private)
- **Under no circumstances should you share your private ssh key or your file name**

### 3. Connecting your SSH key to GitHub

- Go to your profile and click on settings

- Go into your SSH and GPG keys tab and click on New SSH key
![](SSH_GPG_Keys.png)
- When added a new key, give the key a title, set the type to Authentication (default) and enter your PUBLIC key in the key section
  - To copy over your public key use the following in Git Bash ```cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip``` This will copy your Public key in the correct format (replace id_rsa.pub with your public key)
  - Click Add SSH Key to confirm.

### 4. Connecting PyCharm to GitHub

- In the terminal in PyCharm, enter the directory which your repo is, start by entering   
``` 
eval `ssh-agent` (Output: Agent pid ***)
```
- Add in your private key to connect with
```ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa```
- Allow access for Github to connect with your ssh key
```ssh -T git@github.com```
- Set the remote connection as a ssh key.
```git remote set-url origin git@github.com:LukeWeller7/github_SSH.git```
- Setting your pycharm git repo as your origin link to the GitHub repo
```git remote add origin git@github.com:LukeWeller7/github_SSH.git```
- Check that the connection is complete with
```git remote -v```
```
Expected Output:
origin  git@github.com:LukeWeller7/github_SSH.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:LukeWeller7/github_SSH.git (push)
```
- Save your files and pushing your local repo to GitHub with
  - Add working files to staging area ```git add .```
  - Commit files to local repository ```git commit -m "comment here"```
  - Push files in local repository to github ```git push -u origin main```
